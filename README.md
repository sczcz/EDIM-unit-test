##Unit test repository of project EDIM
//

**Why a separate repository for unit test?**

Short answer: To make dependency management easier.
Longer answer: Default repository has no way of managing dependencies in a way that is not a huge hassle. Hence
this repo was created as a maven project. Default test-dependencies are found in main-branch in pom.xml (JUnit 5 and Mockito).

For a complete guide on how to run the program please read the main repo readme:

**Alright, but who has done what here, exactly?**

The name of the branches should tell you what you need to know.


**PLEASE NOTE!**
Sprint 3 tests created and conducted by Hugo Andersson and Mikael Nilsson can be found under a separate fork here:
